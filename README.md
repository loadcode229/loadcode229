### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**loadcode229/loadcode229** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- My Mod 4 Project called Recipe Manager powered by JavaScript(Frontend)/Rails(Backend/API)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- How to get better at vocally explaining my Object Oriented code step by step, route by route. Shortly moving to React hopefully.
